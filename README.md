# Blinkys_Castle
Using Adafruit's CircuitPlayground Express and a Gizmo TFT to make a crawler game as I learn CircuitPython.
I used the MIT licensing because I think that is what Lady Ada uses for her Adafruit programs and modules.

The files in the lib folder are from Adafruit as is the Castle_Sprite_Sheet.bmp file.  I used one of the
16x16 sprites and then copied it and edited it into a 22x16 sprite.  I copied the original and edited it
to make it look like the snake is moving.  I still have some editing to do on the graphics, such as fixing
Blinky's tongue.  I also want to make a moving away and toward sprites.
